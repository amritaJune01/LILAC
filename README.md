# Machine-Learning-Project

Over the last few years, the modern-day lifestyle has evolved with an increasing count of people adopting sedentary living with continuous exposure to consistent stress and degrading environmental conditions. In such times, early detection of a major risk to develop a highly dreadful disease for timely medication may prove to be pivotal for Bio-Medicine Computational Sciences for improving human health. LILAC provides an automated solution to visualize, analyze, process, and hence predict the expected risk of Lung Cancer through available data records concerning the lifestyle of people. The project attempts to propose a detailed comparison of popular Machine Learning techniques with an aim to predict the risk of Lung Cancer effectively by analyzing and refining the set of available attributes through several feature selection processes to select the factors which strongly affect the chances of Lung Cancer. An effective summation and overall comparison of the executed techniques to select the best technique is a major highlight of the presented work. The best feature selection technique is attributed to Sequential Feature Selection as it led to a significant improvement in the prediction of the risk through relatively easier models with high accuracy. The proposed work enhances the accuracy of models which are relatively easy to build and explain and hence improves the time complexity when the model is built with a huge amount of data available.
